# Snake_Game
This project is a classic implementation of the Snake game using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game challenges players to navigate a snake to consume food items while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, increasing the difficulty of the game. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score by consuming as many food items as possible.
